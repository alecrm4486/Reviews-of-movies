# Reviews-of-movies
In this project I apply a CNN on sentiment classification of movie reviews using the IMDb dataset, 
unlike the majority of studies I use an scale of eight categories to classify the sentiment polarity.
I am using a Large Movie Review v1.0 dataset that contains 50.000k reviews spliting into 25K train and 25K test files.
The entire review collection is composed by no more that 30 reviews for movie to avoid correlation rating among the reviews.
Concerning labels, each review file name contains an score that indicates its score, thus a score less or equal to 4 out of 10 indicates a negative review. 
Likewise a score equal o higher to 7 out of 10 are considered positive reviews.
